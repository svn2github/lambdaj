Have you encountred in you programming life a situation where you will aggregate some information from a list of object and you will make a string separated by a comma?

{{{
StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer();
for(Object o: objects) {
  if(canAccomplishSomething(o)) {
    stringBuffer.append(o.toString()).append(", ");
  }
}

String string = stringBuffer.toString().replaceAll(", $", "");
}}}

personally, before lambdaj i have used code below many times. Now i solve this issue using follow statement:

{{{
join(objects, that(accomplishSomething()));
}}}

where join is a lambdaj function that take 2 arguments:
 * an iterable of object
 * an hamcrest matcher

our good worker join iterate over iterable and try to match every object with accomplishSomething matcher. Each object that matches, is joined in a string using comma separator.

simplest using of object is to concatenate list of string.. retrived by lambdaj using collect or select function. See HowToSelect
{{{
assertThat(join(asList("first", "second")), is(equalTo("first, second")));
}}}
