lambdaj is borned as idea reading follow blog post http://jroller.com/ghettoJedi/entry/using_hamcrest_for_iterators. Special thanks to Håkan Råberg that have suggested this idea.

In our real complex insurance software implementation we use domain object strong connected. where there are many level of nested object from root to leaf that contains values. those objects was aggregated with in many manner and we have many repeated code:
{{{
for(Object o: objects)
  for(Object o1: o.getChildren())
    for(Object o2: o1.getChildren())
      for(Object o3: o2.getChildren())
        doSomethingWith(o3);
}}}

this situation is very common in our code base. For us doSomething is a function that tell to object to operate its behaivor or ask to object to return some values that is computed in procedural way.. for instance we ask to our object its value to get total values of grouped object.

we have found a good way to express those issue using java in a manner that emulate function programming over collection of object.

forEach(select(from(objects).getChildren().getChildren().getChildren(), where("country", is(equalTo(France))))).doSomething();
